# Installation

1. First you need to install Jupyter and Python.  The easiest way is to install anaconda:
    1. Download and install anaconda with **Python 3.6** from [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
    3. Further instructions available at [Installing Jupyter using Anaconda and Conda](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#id3)
2. Now you can directly install `pyanp` from a Terminal (or Windows console)
    ```
    pip install pyanp
    ```
    or if you want to install the bleeding edge from github:
    ```
    pip install git+https://github.com/wjladams/pyanp.git
    ```
